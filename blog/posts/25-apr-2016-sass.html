    <div class="content">
        <p>Well, I learned about all I could learn about SASS today in a Udemy course. I think it's extremely powerful, but not difficult to use. I moved all the CSS over to SASS today, although I'm not using many of the features yet. After I write this I'll be fixing a few bugs I see, adjusting the background and making the text easier to read. </p>

        <p>I got jekyll installed and setup, just need to spend some quality time with the documentation and figure out how theming works with it. It uses Liquid for templating and that also looks reasonably easy but again powerful. </p>

        <p>I use something called <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com">RescueTime</a> to keep track of what I get done and where I spend too much time goofing off. I'm usually only around 35% productive due to things like Gitter and IRC, however as it stands right now today is at 72% productive, a new record. I love how it makes me pay attention to how much time I waste in a day.</p>

        <p>I'm starting to think of ideas for the SIA Development website. I was going to mock it up in Photoshop, however I don't know how to use it for anything but basic touch-ups on photos. I want to learn, but at the same time I should just hire a designer to do the layout for me. But that requires money, and I'm always short on that!</p>

        <p>ok, this is a giant pain in the arse. To write a new blog post right now, I take the code from the previous post, delete the actual post text, then start writing the post. Jekyll save me! Then I have to update several places in the blog home page, and the actual home page. I'm going to have to update the rest of the website no matter what, so I don't know if I'll be posting too much on this blog unless it's big, or cool. No more personal crap like my old blog.</p>

        <p>Ok, checking the post out, I need to change a few css tags as well. Ooh lightning, hopefully it storms because I'm miserable right now, all sweaty and gross.</p>
