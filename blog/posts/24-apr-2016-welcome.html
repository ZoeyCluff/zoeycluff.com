        <p> I'm new to building websites. I started in February with a Udemy course "The Complete Web Developer Course" with an amazing instructor. Before this I knew enough to be dangerous with Wordpress (used it for work), and I knew how to use Jekyll (Granted at that point I never touched anything except copying in the posts with some markdown). Then after I was part way through the Udemy course, I found out about Free Code Camp and started working on that. At this point I've finished all of the Complete Web Developer course, and the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap and some Javascript on FCC. I'm pretty capable of HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (although I loathe anything with Bootstrap, I can never design anything I actually like.) I've done sections on PHP and Javascript however I just can't get the hang of it. I need to start from scratch on them and try again, maybe the 2nd time is the charm. I'd love to start playing with things like React and Ember, but they require more JS skills than I know currently. </p>
        <p> Right now I'm creating blog posts manually and updating everything by hand. While this is a giant pain in the arse, I need to figure out how Jekyll theming works and create the theme for it. It'll basically look exactly like the main site, just with some automated goodies. Today is day three working on the site and I'm in love with it. Maybe the secret to making sites you don't hate is to take your time and plan the layout first. Usually I just wing it and the site winds up in the trash not long after because I think it's ugly and I'd hate to put my name on it. This one I like, and I'll probably be implementing a similar theme on the SIA Development site, just with a differe nt color scheme. </p>
        <p>The site is currently hosted on AWS, although the way the site Is right now, I could probably trash the VPS it's running on and use a S3 bucket as it's fine for static hosting. This is fine for now, however I'll eventually be adding some JS to practice and add some cool features to the site. However, I looked at a site that uses a lot of JS things to fade in text, and his CSS file when un-minified was 8100 lines! 1100 alone were for the fade in. That's just crazy. I thought my site was bloated with 235 lines of CSS split up into two files (need to re-organize it so common things go in one file to make it easier to edit. And comments so I can go back to this and know what I was doing. Most of my classes make sense except for the two columns on the home page (Easter eggâ€¦). I also need to do comments on the OPS site, and I also need to finish the contact forms for it. PHP and JS are kicking my ass. </p>
        <p> Ok, so I've coded this entire website on my laptop. It's a pretty high powered laptop (although it's from 2011, I'm pretty sure it's faster than my desktop that's newer), however it puts out SO much heat! While I was installing Haskell (because I want to torture myself with functional programming), the CPU cores hit 95C (203F). It's a 45-watt chip, how can this thing get so hot?! Even right now in Spotify, a handful of Chrome tabs, Word and winSCP, it's running along at 60C. I probably need to redo the thermal compound on it and hopefully that'll fix the temps. I don't like laptops that make me sweat! </p>
        <p> Well, I started working on the website around 13:30 today, and it's currently 01:00. I should probably get ready for bed and stop coding. I've taken like a two hour break total. I love hyperfocusing! </p>
        <p>Hmm, Writing in Word then copying into Brackets messes up the ' and I have to do a replace all. Good to know.</p>
